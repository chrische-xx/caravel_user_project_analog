# 8-bit SAR-ADC with offset calibration

This is a mixed-mode project featuring a 8-bit SAR-ADC, with offset calibration.
The logic section is synthesized using the openlane digital flow.

## Layout

The layout is created using magic as a pcell generator and drc checker, while the 
connection of the design is done using klayout.

## Architecture

The ADC is composed of a differential top-plate sampled dac, which is made from an array of MIM capacitors.
The comparator is a regenerative comparator, which is followed by a latch to retain the output state during
reset. The latch output is fed into the logic section, which performs the standard binary search algorithm.

## Simulation

The simulation is carried out using ngspice using the mixed-mode xspice capabilities.
The digital section is synthesized using yosys that can then be bridged to/from the
analog section.

The Schematics are created using xschem, which also serves as the simulation framework.

The simulation output can then be viewed in both analog and digital domain.
